German continuous electricity market analysis, work done as part of PhD studies on Wroclaw University of Science and Technology

## Quick start
If you already have the complete dataset in Data directory, you can go to Forecasting and run lasso_forecasting.py or all_deliveries_simu.py.
The results for each model, delivery and transaction time are stored in a separate .csv file to allow for retrieval of information after the simulation fails or is interrupted.
